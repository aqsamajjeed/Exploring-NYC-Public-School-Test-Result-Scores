# 🏫 Exploring NYC Public School SAT Scores

## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes SAT performance across public high schools in New York City using real-world education data. The SAT, composed of **Math**, **Reading**, and **Writing** sections, plays a critical role in the college admissions process.

Through this analysis, we aim to identify:
- The best-performing schools overall
- Top performers in specific SAT components
- Variations in performance across NYC boroughs
- Insights for parents, educators, and policymakers

## 🔍 Key Analysis Questions

### 🧮 1. Which schools have the best Math results?
Identified the schools with average Math scores above 640 and ranked them to find top quantitative performers in the city.

### 🏆 2. What are the top 10 performing schools overall?
Created a combined SAT score (Math + Reading + Writing) to rank and highlight the top 10 high schools with the highest total performance.

### 🌆 3. Which borough has the highest variability in SAT scores?
Measured the **standard deviation** of total SAT scores in each borough to find where performance is most inconsistent — helping reveal educational gaps and inequalities.
